## Week 2
### Planning
- Get familiar with Torcs by playing with my_driver.py
- Implement a very simple regression neural network with targets acceleration, brake, and steer 
- Use autoencoders to reduce the feature space of the sensor data

### Output
- A much better understanding of the torcs environment and RNNs
- Feed forward neural network that predicts same values for every timestep
- Recurrent neural network that almost gives some output but has some dimention issue (easy to fix)
- Autoencoder (does it work Alex?)
- Able to drive the car ourselves, but not yet able to gather sensor data

### Questions
- How to collect sensor data from manually driving the car?
- How do we implement an Echo State Network? There aren't any good looking packages that we can find.

## Week 3
### Planning 
- Create LSTM
- Understand training data


### Output
- Produced training data based on rule based driving
- Gained insight into driver calls (i.e. when is it called?)
- LSTM working
- Sent e-mail to Mark (call for help)

### Questions
- All versions of NN are not working on the data. Why is this? Maybe (3-target) regression is not the best solution?
- Fundamental wrong approach (wait for e-mail Mark)?
- Error in LSTM?
- Reinforcement Learning?
