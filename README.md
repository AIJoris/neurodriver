## Week 2
### Planning
- Get familiar with Torcs by playing with my_driver.py
- Implement a very simple regression neural network with targets acceleration, brake, and steer 
- Use autoencoders to reduce the feature space of the sensor data

### Output
- A much better understanding of the torcs environment and RNNs
- Feed forward neural network that predicts same values for every timestep
- Recurrent neural network that almost gives some output but has some dimention issue (easy to fix)
- Autoencoder (does it work Alex?)
- Able to drive the car ourselves, but not yet able to gather sensor data

### Questions
- How to collect sensor data from manually driving the car?
- How do we implement an Echo State Network? There aren't any good looking packages that we can find.
